## Agent Guidelines for This Milestone

<!-- Instructions for AI agents working on goals in this milestone. -->

When working on tasks in this milestone, anchor them to the **goals** above.

### Project Boundaries

<!-- Define which parts of the codebase each type of change should touch. -->

- *Change type 1* → *which module / directory*
- *Change type 2* → *which module / directory*

### Development Approach

<!-- List key development principles and conventions for this milestone. -->

<!-- 1. Create one goals file per milestone (goals1.md, goals2.md) -->
<!-- 2. Each goal has: Intent, Deliverables, Acceptance Criteria   -->
<!-- 3. Goals can have VARIANTS (A/B/C) for alternative approaches -->
<!--    - See AgenticWorkFlow.md for variant conventions            -->
<!-- 4. Goals can have PHASES for large implementations            -->
<!--    - See AgenticWorkFlow.md for phase and handover conventions -->
<!-- 5. Update the summary table at the top as goals progress      -->
<!-- 6. Mark completed goals with ✅ in both title and table       -->
<!-- 7. Keep Out of Scope sections honest — they prevent creep     -->
